## [Fork] — 2026-10-04

Fork-specific changes, rebased onto upstream `3.12.0`. Maintained by
[umarmf](https://github.com/umarmf); provenance and licensing in [`ATTRIBUTION.md`](ATTRIBUTION.md).

### Added
- `pbi desktop open/close/status` — Power BI Desktop lifecycle management (launch, Analysis Services port discovery, connect/persist, stop).
- `pbi model deps` — static per-table dependency scan of a PBIP project, classifying tables `used-report` / `used-model` / `review` / `unused` (no Desktop or connection). Bundled `power-bi-unused-tables` skill.
- `pbi static decode` / `pbi static encode` — Base64 + raw-DEFLATE static-table codec (rows ↔ paste-ready M).
- `pbi format display-units`, `pbi format data-labels`, `pbi format set-object` — PBIR output-formatting helpers.
- `pbi table update --description/--hidden` — update table description and/or visibility.
- Extended `pbi visual where` with `--all-pages`, `--title-pattern`, `--uses-measure`, `--uses-field`.
- `pbi filters where` and `pbi filters add-advanced`; `filters list --condition`.
- `pbi bookmarks set-scope` — all-visuals plus `--suppress-data`, the recommended config for bookmarks that must not reset slicer selections.
- `reference/` — PBIP field notes: manifest, guardrails, guidelines, gotchas.
- Test suite grown to 696 tests.

### Changed
- Rebased onto upstream `3.12.0` (adopts the `field_resolver`-based `visual bind` / `bulk-bind`).

## [3.12.0] - 2026-09-18

First PyPI release since 3.11.1, so it also ships the 3.11.2 fixes below.

### Fixed
- `pbi visual bind` no longer wraps every slicer, card and table field as a `Measure`. Slicers bound to a dimension column produced a `Measure` reference that Power BI Desktop could not resolve, so the slicer rendered broken. The same happened to columns in table visuals and to `textSlicer`, `listSlicer` and `advancedSlicerVisual` ([#19](https://github.com/MinaSaad1/pbi-cli/issues/19)).
- Column vs Measure is now resolved per field from the semantic model: first the TMDL or `model.bim` the report's `definition.pbir` points to, then the live `pbi connect` model (opened only for fields missing on disk), then a per-visual role default in which slicers default to Column. Names are canonicalised to the model's casing, and a measure referenced under the wrong table is written against its home table.
- Fields not found in the model produce a `warnings` entry instead of silently guessing.
- A column bound to a value role (chart Y, matrix values, card, table) is now wrapped in the implicit aggregation Power BI Desktop applies, instead of a bare `Column` reference. The function comes from the column's `summarizeBy` in the model, falling back to Sum for numeric columns. On charts and matrices a non-summarizable column (text, or `summarizeBy: none`) counts, as Desktop does; tables and cards keep it as a plain column. Category, row, legend and slicer fields are never aggregated.

### Added
- `--kind auto|column|measure` on `pbi visual bind` and `pbi visual bulk-bind` to force the wrapper.
- `--column`, `--line`, `--x` and `--y` on `pbi visual bind`, matching `bulk-bind`. `--column` binds table columns and matrix column groups.
- `bind` output includes `kind` and `resolved_by` for each field.
- `--aggregation sum|average|count|distinct-count|min|max|median|stdev|variance|none` on `pbi visual bind` and `bulk-bind` to override the implicit aggregation. Function codes follow Microsoft's PBIR semanticQuery schema.

## [3.11.2] - Unreleased

Never published to PyPI. These changes first shipped in 3.12.0.

### Fixed
- `pbi report reload` is no longer a silent no-op on Windows 11 24H2 and later. Process discovery shelled out to `wmic`, which Microsoft removed from current Windows, so every lookup raised `FileNotFoundError`. The bare `except` swallowed it and `sync_desktop` reported "Power BI Desktop is not running" while it was plainly running. Now uses PowerShell's `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process` and parses JSON, so command lines containing quotes survive intact ([#17](https://github.com/MinaSaad1/pbi-cli/pull/17), thanks [@BMATPowerBI](https://github.com/BMATPowerBI)).
- Desktop discovery no longer discards the correct process when the `.Report` folder is named differently from the `.pbip`. The hint arriving from the report layer is a `.Report` path, so matching on its stem alone filtered out the match in thin-report layouts.
- The save prompt after `WM_CLOSE` is polled rather than checked once. Desktop does not raise it promptly when busy (notably straight after a table refresh), so a single check could look before the prompt appeared, send no key, and strand the save. The wait also ends as soon as the process exits, so a close with nothing to save no longer sits out the full timeout.
- The close deadline is no longer 20 seconds. Writing a large model routinely exceeds it, and the old limit expired mid-save.
- `power-bi-report` skill no longer claims `pbi report reload` "sends a keyboard shortcut" to Power BI Desktop. The actual implementation calls `sync_desktop()`: it saves and closes the open `.pbip`, re-applies any PBIR edits that Desktop's save would overwrite, then reopens the file. The stale wording was confusing users who expected a `Ctrl+Shift+F5` keypress and looked it up in Microsoft's shortcut docs ([#8](https://github.com/MinaSaad1/pbi-cli/issues/8)).
- Auto-sync section of the same skill now states explicitly that sync closes and reopens Desktop after each write, so the close/reopen behavior triggered by `pbi visual update` (and other write commands) is no longer surprising. `--no-sync` remains the escape hatch.
- `pbi --version` reports the installed version again. `__version__` was hardcoded and had drifted to 3.10.10; it is now read from package metadata, so it cannot drift from the released version again ([#18](https://github.com/MinaSaad1/pbi-cli/issues/18)).
- `power-bi-report` and `power-bi-visuals` examples used a three-positional `pbi measure create` form that Click rejects. They now pass the name positionally with `-e/--expression` and `-t/--table`.

### Security
- Desktop discovery can no longer select the wrong Power BI Desktop instance. The hint predicate matched substrings against every ancestor directory name, so ordinary path components acted as wildcards -- a username directory made an unrelated `Mina_Test.pbip` match a hint under `C:/Users/mina/`. Because `_find_desktop_process` hands its first match to `_close_with_save`, a false match force-closed, saved and reopened someone else's session. Matching is now exact.

### Changed
- The "All Commands" table listed `skills install/list/uninstall` alongside `pbi` subcommands, though the group is registered on the `pbi-cli` entry point only. It now carries the `pbi-cli` prefix explicitly ([#18](https://github.com/MinaSaad1/pbi-cli/issues/18)).
- Skills now warn about the schema errors that stop a `.pbip` from opening in Desktop: `power-bi-report` documents the `.pbip` artifact and `definition.pbir` rules, `power-bi-themes` lists theme properties that crash Desktop on open, and `power-bi-visuals` notes that measures must exist in the TMDL before `visual bind` ([#9](https://github.com/MinaSaad1/pbi-cli/pull/9), thanks [@Priya-BI](https://github.com/Priya-BI)).

### Removed
- `src/pbi_cli/utils/desktop_reload.py` -- dead code. The Ctrl+Shift+F5 keyboard-shortcut module was an earlier implementation no longer imported anywhere in `src/`. The `[reload]` extras in `pyproject.toml` (which installs `pywin32`) is unchanged because `desktop_sync.py` still depends on it.

## [3.11.1] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- `power-bi-custom-visuals` skill now teaches Claude to populate the four metadata fields `pbiviz package` strict-validates (`author.name`, `author.email`, `visual.description`, `visual.supportUrl`). Without this, the first end-to-end run would package-fail with "Author name is not specified" and burn the 5-turn no-progress cap on a metadata error rather than a code error. Author defaults are sourced from `git config user.name`/`user.email`; description is derived from the user's spec; `supportUrl` is a placeholder (`https://example.com`) the user replaces before AppSource publish.
- AGENTS.md template clarifies `pbiviz.json` is no longer flatly locked: `version` is auto-bumped by the skill, metadata fields are user-editable, structural fields (`apiVersion`, `style`, `capabilities`) remain locked.

## [3.11.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Custom visual authoring** -- vibe-code Power BI custom visuals end-to-end with the new `power-bi-custom-visuals` Claude skill. The skill scaffolds a TypeScript project sibling to your `.pbip` via `npx pbiviz new`, iterates against the Power BI Visuals SDK with `tsc --noEmit` between every change, packages a `.pbiviz`, and embeds it into the report. Auto-installs Node and `pbiviz` (with consent), pins SDK to a known-good version, runs an npm allowlist for common deps. Inner loop is agent-driven on TypeScript errors; visual correctness is checked once with the user at the end.
- `pbi visual import-custom <pbiviz>` -- copy a locally-built `.pbiviz` into `StaticResources/RegisteredResources/` and register it in `report.json`. `--replace` overwrites by GUID for the iteration loop.
- `pbi visual list-custom` -- list embedded and public custom visuals with a `kind` distinguisher.
- `pbi visual remove-custom <guid-or-name>` -- deregister and physically delete the `.pbiviz`.

## [3.10.6] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- `visual bind` no longer writes the legacy `Commands` block (SemanticQueryDataShapeCommand) to `visual.json`. PBIR 2.7.0 uses `additionalProperties: false` on the query object, so the `Commands` field is a hard schema violation. Only `queryState` projections are now written.
- `pbi report validate` and the full PBIR validator no longer flag a missing `layoutOptimization` field as an error. The real Microsoft schema does not list it as required; the previous check was against a stale internal schema.
- `pbi report set-background` now always writes `transparency: 0` alongside the color. Power BI Desktop defaults a missing `transparency` property to 100 (fully invisible), making the color silently unrendered. The new `--transparency` flag (0-100, default 0) lets callers override for semi-transparent backgrounds.

### Added
- `--no-sync` flag on `report`, `visual`, `filters`, and `bookmarks` command groups. Suppresses the per-command Desktop auto-sync for scripted multi-step builds. Use `pbi report reload` for a single explicit sync at the end of the script.

## [3.10.5] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- ASCII banner: replaced incorrect hand-crafted art with the official design from `assets/banner.svg`. The `I` in PBI is now correctly narrow, and a small `███╗/╚══╝` block serves as the visible `-` separator between PBI and CLI.

## [3.10.4] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- ASCII banner displayed in terminal when `pbi` is invoked with no subcommand. Renders in Power BI yellow on color terminals, plain text fallback on legacy terminals without Unicode support. Skipped when `--json` flag is used.

## [3.10.3] - 2026-04-05

### Changed
- Claude Code integration is now fully opt-in. `pbi connect` no longer writes to `~/.claude/`. Run `pbi-cli skills install` explicitly to register skills with Claude Code. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for full details.
- `pbi-cli` is now a dedicated management entry point (`pbi-cli skills install/uninstall/list`). Skills subcommands have been removed from the `pbi` entry point.

### Fixed
- DLL licensing: Microsoft Analysis Services client library DLLs bundled in `src/pbi_cli/dlls/` are now correctly attributed under the Microsoft Software License Terms, not sublicensed under MIT. Full EULA text in `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`.
- `pyproject.toml` updated to PEP 639 dual SPDX expression (`MIT AND LicenseRef-Microsoft-AS-Client-Libraries`) with `license-files` declaration.
- README.md and README.pypi.md updated to reflect the correct 3-step setup flow: `pipx install` → `pbi-cli skills install` → `pbi connect`.

## [3.10.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- Split `power-bi-report` skill into 5 focused skills: `power-bi-report` (overview), `power-bi-visuals`, `power-bi-pages`, `power-bi-themes`, `power-bi-filters` (12 skills total)

## [3.9.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- `pbi database diff-tmdl` command: compare two TMDL export folders offline, summarise changes (tables, measures, columns, relationships, model properties); lineageTag-only changes are stripped to avoid false positives

### Fixed

- `theme_set` resourcePackages structure now matches Desktop format (flat `items`, not nested `resourcePackage`)
- `visual_bind` type annotation corrected from `list[dict[str, str]]` to `list[dict[str, Any]]`
- `tmdl_diff` hierarchy changes now reported as `hierarchies_*` instead of falling through to `other_*`
